## 🧪 Post-Lab Activity: 
**Project Name:** [Insert Lab Name, e.g., The Weather Dashboard]
**Estimated Time:** 30–45 minutes

# 📝 Overview
The goal of this post-lab activity is to solidify your understanding of State, Props, and Component Lifecycle. Now that we’ve built the base application together, it’s time to experiment, break things, and fix them.

# 🎯 Learning Objectives
**By the end of this activity, you will be able to:**

* Identify how data flows between parent and child components.
* Debug common React console errors (like the "key" prop warning).
* Implement a new feature independently using the `useState` hook.

# 🛠️ The Challenge
Complete the following tasks to enhance the application we built during the session:

**Phase 1: Feature Expansion**
* **Add a Reset Button:** Create a new component that clears all current state and returns the UI to its initial look.
* **Conditional Styling:** Change the background color of a component based on a state value (e.g., if a counter is > 10, turn the text red).

**Phase 2: Refactoring**
* Break down the main `App.js` into at least two smaller sub-components to practice prop drilling.

**🧐 Reflection Questions**
Answer these in a new *`REFLECTION.md`* file in your repo:
1. **The "Aha!" Moment:** What was the most confusing part of the lab, and how did you eventually understand it?
2. **Data Flow:** If you wanted to share state between two "sibling" components, where would that state need to live?
3. **Hooks:** Why can't we call `useState` inside a regular JavaScript `if` statement or a loop?
