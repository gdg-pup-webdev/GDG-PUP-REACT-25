# GDG-PUP-REACT-25

# 🚀 Welcome to the React.js Study Jam
React is a powerful, open-source JavaScript library developed by Meta for building dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
Whether you're looking to build a simple portfolio or a complex web application like Netflix or Airbnb, React is the industry-standard tool to get it done.

# 🌟 Why React?
* **Component-Based:** Build small, reusable pieces of UI (like buttons or navbars) and stack them like LEGO bricks to create complex apps.
* **Fast Rendering:** Uses a Virtual DOM to update only the parts of the page that actually change, making your apps feel snappy.
* **Massive Ecosystem:** A huge community means endless libraries, tools, and job opportunities.

# 📚 What You Will Learn
This Study Jam is designed to take you from "Hello World" to building functional, stateful applications. Here is the roadmap:

**1. The Building Blocks (JSX & Components)**
Understand how to combine HTML and JavaScript using JSX and how to break your UI into independent Functional Components.

**2. Passing Data (Props)**
Learn the "one-way data flow" by passing information from parent components to children using **Props**.

**3. Making it Interactive (State & Hooks)**
Master the `useState` hook to handle data that changes over time (like counters, form inputs, or toggles) and `useEffect` for handling side effects like fetching data.

**4. Handling User Events**
Learn how to respond to user actions like clicks, typing, and form submissions the "React way."

**5. Lists and Conditional Rendering**
Efficiently render multiple items using `.map()` and show/hide elements based on specific conditions.

# 🛠️ Prerequisites
To get the most out of this jam, you should have a basic understanding of:
* **HTML & CSS** (Structuring and styling web pages)
* **Modern JavaScript** (ES6+) (Arrow functions, destructuring, and map/filter)
